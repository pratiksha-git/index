     <pre>A Fairy Song by William Shakespeare

        Over hill, over dale,
        Thorough bush, thorough brier,
        Over park, over pale,
        Thorough flood, thorough fire!
        I do wander everywhere,
        Swifter than the moon's sphere;
        And I serve the Fairy Queen,
        To dew her orbs upon the green;
        The cowslips tall her pensioners be;
        In their gold coats spots you see;
        Those be rubies, fairy favours;
        In those freckles live their savours;
        I must go seek some dewdrops here,
        And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
